1. Create a branch with the pattern `yourname/branch-name`
1. Code
1. Create Pull Request to master
1. If the Pull Request has a Trello ticket
  * Move it to QA if has functionality to be tested by QA
  * Move it to "Done" if doesn't have functionality to be tested by QA
1. Tests must be green
1. Get at least one other developer's review and approval
  * Reviewers must leave an approval comment
1. If changes are made to the pull request after review, it needs to be reviewed again
1. Authors merge their own branches after approval and gut check


## Working with a large Pull Request

1. If the Pull Request is large and the code can be split up into independent chunks,
it is best to split it up.


## Frontend

* If there are visual changes or new features, attach a screenshot
  * Before and after shots are nice
